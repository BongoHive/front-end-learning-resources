# learning-resources

This consists of small exercises and assignments to prove the understanding of one in a particular topic  
All the projects should be hosted on github and done using an online text editor like codesandbox.io

**N.B:** Make sure that resources are good for beginners and aren't confusing  
         Resources should start from basic to build up to bigger projects and more understanding.
